## Lab01, Instructions

In this practical assignment, you are to add your responses to the questions in blue of the lab. Your reflection should be about a page and contain clear and meaningful language. Please use markdown language to format your reflection piece.

Please write below this line to address the above-mentioned points. Replace the word, `TODO` with your response.

### First Tool

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?

 Polyphen2 is used in SARS-CoV-2's genomics research.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?

 Polyphen2's job is to use straightforward physical and comparative considerations in order to provide the prediction of possible impact of an amino acid substitution on the structure and function of a human protein.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?

 This tool is necessary to develop because in one part from the scientific journal article, it mentioned that Polyphen2, along with PROVEAN, SNAP2, as well as other tools from mentioned researches, have great contributions in not only predicting novel putative natural inhibitors but also re-experimenting many past used ancient synthetic drugs with antiviral activities such as chloroquine (malaria), hydroxylchloroquine (maalaria), zanamivir (influenza A & B virus), indinavir (HIV), saquinavir (HIV), remdesivir (SARS-CoV), ralterravin (HIV), streptomycine, ciprofloxacin, zanamivir (influenza virus), glycyrrhizic acid (anti inflammation)..., which these medications could be used to fight against SARS-CoV-2.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?

 The misuse of this tool is not mentioned in the paper. But with my prediction, the wrong use can cause the change in algorithm, which can cause the change in analysis and lead to the fail understanding of SAR-CoV-2.


### Second Tool

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?

 PubChem is the silico screening or computer-aided drug design that helps finiding solution to fight the virus, as it aid designing drug process. This tool is used in silico drug design and it works to support finding the most effective drug that would fight against SAR-CoV-2.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?

 The tool provides chemical structure database, which contains information on chemical compounds including name, molecular formula, chemical and physical properties, biological activities, toxic effects, literatures and so on.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?

 This tool, among with other designing tools, would be necessary in drug designing process because it provides useful information to researchers. It also frequently update its dataset as an effort to provide the most authenticated to the users, since the study of SAR-CoV-2 is new and always required latest data to support those studies.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?

 New updated information and databases could provide a different results of researchers' studies. Therefore, researchers need to have certain expectations about the change in outcomes of their studies, since there are many researchers and institutions are studying this field.
